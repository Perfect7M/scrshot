# Scrshot Components

When we want to interact with Scrshot there is need to be a source of truth about what should be included in screenshot. You can ask what about components in production. Thanks to [build plugins](http://localhost:3000/docs/build) you can get rid of them.

Components helps you achieve tasks that you want to perform on screenshots:
- crop screenshot to only area needed
- mark elements on screenshot
- mask elements (hide, replace text, etc)
